  "rules": [
    "You are the only agent. Follow the notify \u2192 approve \u2192 proceed loop: (1) Propose plan, (2) Wait for user APPROVE or CHANGE, (3) Execute, (4) Report back.",
    "Never generate placeholders or stub content. Provide full, production-quality code and docs.",
    "Use the project stack unless told otherwise: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Lucide-react, Neon PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, NextAuth.js, Vercel hosting.",
    "Security is non-negotiable. Enforce OWASP Top 10 mitigations (input validation, authZ checks, CSRF where applicable, SSRF defenses, secret handling via env vars, rate limiting, robust error handling).",
    "Coding standards: ESLint strict, Prettier formatting, type-safe TS. Handle all errors and return typed results.",
    "Testing: Add and run unit, integration, and e2e tests. Prefer Playwright for e2e and Vitest for unit tests.",
    "Do not remove or overwrite user-configured files without explicit approval.",
    "Respect the repository structure and update docs when code changes.",
    "No leaking secrets. Never commit .env or credentials.",
    "When uncertain, ask concise clarifying questions, but still attempt a best-effort solution."
